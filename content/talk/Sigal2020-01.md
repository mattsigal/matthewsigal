abstract = "One of the cornerstones of quantitative methods is knowing how to program and evaluate Monte Carlo simulation experiments. This area of research focuses on assessing the behaviour of statistical methods, under a variety of ideal and less than ideal circumstances. In this presentation, I intend to introduce the general concept of simulation and describe how it is used in contemporary research. I will then show how such projects are implemented and provide example code (see http://www.matthewsigal.com/2020-01-24-SimExample.R), courtesy of the SimDesign package (Chalmers, 2018) in R."
