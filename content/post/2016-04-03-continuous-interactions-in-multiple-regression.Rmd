After some brief conversations during consulting about how to construct interaction terms for multiple regression (and why centering variables beforehand is important), I put together a short demonstration of R's default behaviour when using the built-in convenience functions (specifically `*`, but also applies to formulas that use `^`).

The vignette is posted here: [https://rpubs.com/mattsigal/reg_interactions](https://rpubs.com/mattsigal/reg_interactions)

The short-version: `*`, when used with `summary()` does not center the variables, and so models will have issues with VIF. This can be avoided either by creating the interaction terms with `scale()` or looking at the effects using `car::Anova()`.
