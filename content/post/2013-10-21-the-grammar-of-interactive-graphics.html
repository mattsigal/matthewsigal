<p>I gave a presentation today (October 21st, 2013) on the “Grammar of (Interactive) Graphics”. The overarching ideas behind the talk were to discuss Leland Wilkinson’s <em>Grammar of Graphics</em>, its implementation in the <code>R</code> package <code>ggplot2</code>, to introduce some fundamental characteristics of interactive graphics and their present implementations (via <code>R</code> and some <code>JavaScript</code> libraries), and discuss how interactive graphics can be understood within the Grammar of Graphics theory. The presentation concluded with a discussion of one of Hadley Wickham’s latest <code>R</code> packages, <code>ggvis</code>, which refines the previous packages grammar to include some of these goals.</p>
