# Biography

I am a doctoral candidate in the relatively new Quantitative Methods area of Psychology at York University, a field that bridges the gaps between statistical theory, research design and methodology, and their applied aspects, such as client consultation and data interpretation. 

I am a member of Dr. Michael Friendly's lab and am particularly interested in methods of data visualization (especially for truly multivariate analyses), multilevel and structural equation modeling, and alternative modeling strategies within the framework of survival analysis.  Some of my recent research pertains to the implementation of interactive graphics for model diagnostics.
