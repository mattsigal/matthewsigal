abstract = "The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between self-compassion and proactive coping. Participants were undergraduate students (n=99) enrolled at a large university in Toronto who completed two questionnaires; namely, the Self-Compassion Scale and the Proactive Coping Inventory. Our results support the hypothesis that individuals high in self-compassion cope proactively during difficult times, as a significant positive correlation was found between the two scales. Moreover, among the varying types of coping styles, proactive coping best predicted self-compassion, although emotional support seeking also seems to play an important role. An additional outcome of this study was to assess the validity of the Proactive Coping Inventory with a new sample, which was found to be internally consistent in terms of both Cronbachâ€™s alpha and the pattern of correlations among the seven subscales."
