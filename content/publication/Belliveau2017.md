abstract = "Essen Climate Evaluation Schema (Schalast, 2007) data were collected from staff and patients at the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care in Penetanguishine, Canada. Internal consistency and factor structures were compared to those obtained from previous studies conducted in Germany and the United Kingdom. Measurement invariance was assessed across participant type (staff or patient) and forensic level (non-forensic, general forensic, and secure forensic). Comparisons of scale scores and changes over the three collection points are discussed."
