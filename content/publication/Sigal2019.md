# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The following report addresses the impact of preparatory education on first year science grades at two Ontario-based universities. Specifically, the impact of high school and university level preparatory courses on their respective first year university grades will be addressed. A variety of analytic and visualization-based strategies will be employed to outline a narrative about who is taking such courses, and the impact of these courses on student learning. Overall, conclusions point to the usefulness of preparatory education, and for institutions to continue to provide supplementary courses as scaffolding for undergraduate students."
