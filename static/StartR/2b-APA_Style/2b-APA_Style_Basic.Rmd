  This is a sample document to show how R Markdown and papaja can be used to prepare an APA style manuscript. This can be converted into a PDF or Word document, as needed.

The following document provides a template[^1] for using `R` to write reproducible reports, based upon the example provided by Frederik Aust. The creation of these reports relies on the `papaja`, `bookdown`, `rmarkdown,` and `knitr` packages and \LaTeX\ (to generate math notation, format references, and put it all together). 

In the introduction to an article, it is common to cite previous research. For citations to work, you need to supply a .bib file to the `bibliography` parameter in the YAML front matter. These files are plain text, but can be edited in a GUI using JabRef (Windows) or bibDesk (OS X). Once this is done, `[e.g., @james_1890; @bem_2011]` produces a regular citation within parentheses [e.g., @bem_2011; @james_1890]. To cite a source in-text omit the brackets; for example, write `@james_1890` to cite @james_1890.

If you need to display formulas, you can use \LaTeX\ syntax. Inline math must be enclosed in `$` and the result will look like this: $d' = z(H) - z(FA)$. For larger formulas, "displayed" equations are more appropriate and are enclosed in `$$`:
$$d' = \frac{\mu_{old} - \mu_{new}}{\sqrt{0.5(\sigma^2_{old} + \sigma^2_{new})}}$$

[^1]: A simple template can also be created by creating a new R Markdown file through the RStudio menu: File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ RMarkdown $\rightarrow$ From Template $\rightarrow$ APA article. This is shown in Figure\ \@ref(fig:menu).

```{r menu, fig.cap = "papaja's APA6 template is available through the RStudio menu.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/template_selection.png", dpi = 108)
```
