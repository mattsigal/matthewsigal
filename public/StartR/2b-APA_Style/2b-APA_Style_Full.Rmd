The following document provides a template[^1] for using `R` to write reproducible reports, based upon the example provided by Frederik Aust. The creation of these reports relies on the `papaja`, `bookdown`, `rmarkdown,` and `knitr` packages and \LaTeX\ (to generate math notation, format references, and put it all together). 

In the introduction to an article, it is common to cite previous research. For citations to work, you need to supply a .bib file to the `bibliography` parameter in the YAML front matter. These files are plain text, but can be edited in a GUI using JabRef (Windows) or bibDesk (OS X). Once this is done, `[e.g., @james_1890; @bem_2011]` produces a regular citation within parentheses [e.g., @bem_2011; @james_1890]. To cite a source in-text omit the brackets; for example, write `@james_1890` to cite @james_1890.

If you need to display formulas, you can use \LaTeX\ syntax. Inline math must be enclosed in `$` and the result will look like this: $d' = z(H) - z(FA)$. For larger formulas, "displayed" equations are more appropriate and are enclosed in `$$`:
$$d' = \frac{\mu_{old} - \mu_{new}}{\sqrt{0.5(\sigma^2_{old} + \sigma^2_{new})}}$$

[^1]: A simple template can also be created by creating a new R Markdown file through the RStudio menu: File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ RMarkdown $\rightarrow$ From Template $\rightarrow$ APA article. This is shown in Figure\ \@ref(fig:fig1).

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "papaja's APA6 template is available through the RStudio menu.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/template_selection.png", dpi = 108)
```

# Methods

The following sections will discuss the characteristics of our sample, and the measures, procedure and data analysis plan used for this study. 

## Participants

This section typically discusses the characteristics of the sample. Instead of tallying things by hand and copy/pasting the results in, we can use `R` code to pull the values in directly. For example, our present dataset had `r nrow(mixed_data)` participants, `r nrow(mixed_data[mixed_data$Gender == "F",])` of whom were female and `r nrow(mixed_data[mixed_data$Gender == "M",])` were male.

## Materials

Discuss the materials used in the study.

## Procedure and data analysis

Discuss your data analysis plan for the study, most likely with $\alpha = .05$.

# Results

With all of the housekeeping complete, the next step is to actually analyse your data. We will break this down into three sections: Descriptives, Inferential Statistics, and Graphics.

## Descriptives

There are many ways to include descriptive statistics in our article. For example, to include summary statistics of the present data you could use the following code[^2]:

```{r summary, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', strip.white=TRUE}
summary(mixed_data[, -1])
```

[^2]: Note that, by using the `echo=FALSE` parameter, the raw `R` code will be hidden in the report.

But it is kind of ugly. Thankfully, there are ways to print tables with better formatting. For example, using `apa_table()`, and some `dplyr` code:

```{r descriptives, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
descriptives <- mixed_data %>% group_by(Dosage) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(Recall)
    , Median = median(Recall)
    , SD = sd(Recall)
    , Min = min(Recall)
    , Max = max(Recall)
  )
descriptives[, -1] <- printnum(descriptives[, -1])

apa_table(
  descriptives,
  caption = "Descriptive statistics of correct recall by dosage.",
  note = "This table was created with apa_table()"
)
```

## Inferential analyses

We can include the code to run our analysis, as well as generate the output from it within the same document. The function `apa_print()` works on many models and help you report your results (run `methods(apa_print)` for the full list). For example, we could run a factorial ANOVA on the present dataset as follows.

```{r anova, echo = FALSE}
recall_anova <- afex::aov_car(
  Recall ~ (Task * Valence * Dosage) + Error(Subject/(Task * Valence)) + Dosage, 
  data = mixed_data,
  type = 3)
recall_anova_results <- apa_print(recall_anova, es = "pes") # Partial eta-square effect size
```

Now, you can report the results of your analyses. Item valence, `r recall_anova_results$full$Valence`, and the task affected recall performance, `r recall_anova_results$full$Task`; dosage, however, had no effect on recall, `r recall_anova_results$full$Dosage`. Further, there were no significant interactions. This analsis is then typically summarised into an APA style table, which we can produce using `apa_table()`.

```{r anovatable, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
apa_table(
  recall_anova_results$table,
  align = c("l", "r", "c", "r", "r", "r"),
  caption = "ANOVA table for the analyis of the example data set.",
  note = "This is a table created using apa\\_print() and apa\\_table().", 
  escape = FALSE)
```

## Graphical output

It is also customary (and good practice) to include some plots in a manuscript. While you can dive into a separate graphic library like `ggplot2` or `lattice`, `papaja` has a few built-in graphical templates to assist you in producing APA style plots (see `apa_barplot()`, `apa_beeplot()`, `apa_factorial_plot()`, and `apa_lineplot()`). For instance, we might want to generate a beeswarm plot for the present data. 

```{r beeplot, fig.cap = "Bee plot of the example data set. Small points represent individual observations, large points represent means, and error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.", echo = FALSE, dev.args = list(bg = 'white')}
apa_beeplot(mixed_data,
  id = "Subject",
  dv = "Recall",
  factors = c("Task", "Valence", "Dosage"),
  dispersion = conf_int,
  ylim = c(0, 30),
  las = 1,
  args_points = list(cex = 1.5),
  args_arrows = list(length = 0.025))
```

As required by the APA guidelines, figures are deferred to the final pages of the document unless you set `figsintext` to `yes` in the YAML header.

# Discussion

We can finally conclude our article. In doing so, we may want to refer back to some of our tables or figures created above. To do so, use `\@ref(fig:chunk-name)` for figures (e.g., see Figure\ \@ref(fig:beeplot) for our beeswarm plot) or `\@ref(tab:chunk-name)` for tables (e.g., see Table\ \@ref(tab:anovatable) for the ANOVA table).
