      <description>Biography I have a PhD in Quantitative Methods from York University. QM is an area that bridges the gaps between statistical theory, research design and methodology, and their applied aspects, such as client consultation and data interpretation. Please visit this page to peruse a recent version of my curriculum vitae (last updated: March 18, 2017).
I am particularly interested in methods of data visualization (especially for truly multivariate analyses), multilevel and structural equation modeling, and alternative modeling strategies within the framework of survival analysis.</description>
