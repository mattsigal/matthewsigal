      <description>I gave a presentation today (October 21st, 2013) on the “Grammar of (Interactive) Graphics”. The overarching ideas behind the talk were to discuss Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics, its implementation in the R package ggplot2, to introduce some fundamental characteristics of interactive graphics and their present implementations (via R and some JavaScript libraries), and discuss how interactive graphics can be understood within the Grammar of Graphics theory. The presentation concluded with a discussion of one of Hadley Wickham’s latest R packages, ggvis, which refines the previous packages grammar to include some of these goals.</description>
