      <description>Below are the files used for an Introduction to R workshop given at Simon Fraser University on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020, in conjunction with the Psychology Graduate Student Caucus. Due to time constraints, emphasis is placed on what R can do.

      <title>Continuous Interactions in Multiple Regression</title>

      <description>After some brief conversations during consulting about how to construct interaction terms for multiple regression (and why centering variables beforehand is important), I put together a short demonstration of R’s default behaviour when using the built-in convenience functions (specifically *, but also applies to formulas that use ^).
The vignette is posted here: https://rpubs.com/mattsigal/reg_interactions
The short-version: *, when used with summary() does not center the variables, and so models will have issues with VIF.</description>

      <title>The Grammar of (Interactive) Graphics</title>

      <description>I gave a presentation today (October 21st, 2013) on the “Grammar of (Interactive) Graphics”. The overarching ideas behind the talk were to discuss Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics, its implementation in the R package ggplot2, to introduce some fundamental characteristics of interactive graphics and their present implementations (via R and some JavaScript libraries), and discuss how interactive graphics can be understood within the Grammar of Graphics theory. The presentation concluded with a discussion of one of Hadley Wickham’s latest R packages, ggvis, which refines the previous packages grammar to include some of these goals.</description>
